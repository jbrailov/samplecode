# samplecode
# This github repository contains the code and documentation for some of my M.S. Business Analytics coursework. The code aims to exhibit advanced techniques using both Python and R programming languages to perform various data analysis tasks such as data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and modeling. 
# In the "softmax" file, the code demonstrates a function that defines parameters to run a softmax activation function.
# In the "mnist_code" file, the code demonstrates neural networks, activation functions, and the tensorflow library to utilize prediction methods.
# The "ML_code" R code file contains machine learning techniques that perform different transformations on datasets to define the most efficient and accurate model.
